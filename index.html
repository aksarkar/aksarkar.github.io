    <div id="about">
      <p>I am a third-year graduate student
      at <a href="http://mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.
      Refer to my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a> for more detailed information.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>My main research interests are in computational biology. I am
        particularly interested in developing novel algorithms and software
        tools to answer biological questions.</p>

      <h3>Graduate</h3>
      <p>I currently work in the <a href="http://compbio.mit.edu">
          Computational Biology group</a>
          with <a href="http://mit.edu/~manoli">Manolis Kellis</a> at
          the <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/">Computer Science and
          Artificial Intelligence Lab</a>.</p>
      <p>My current work is on understanding how genotype contributes to human
        disease. I have developed statistical methods to interpret genome-wide
        association studies which do not reduce the number of markers
        considered using a p-value threshold. By doing so, we gain the power to
        detect many more common variants which each contribute small effect
        sizes towards the disease phenotype.</p>
      <p>Using epigenetic annotations from
        the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/">ENCODE</a>
        and <a href="http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/">Roadmap
        Epigenomics</a> consortia), we have identified cell-type&ndash;specific
        enhancers which show systematic bias in p-values for association with
        Type 1 Diabetes. Moreover, the methods suggest an unprecedented number
        (thousands) of variants are linked with this disease.</p>

      <h3>Undergraduate</h3>
      <p>I worked in the <a href="http://compgen.unc.edu">UNC Computational
          Genetics Research Group</a>
          with <a href="http://cs.unc.edu/~weiwang">Wei Wang</a>.</p>
      <p>The broad focus of my work was on genetic recombination in model
        organism populations. I collaborated on the implementation of haplotype
        and ancestry inference tools which infer alleles from genotypes and
        inheritance of contiguous regions of the genome. In particular, I
        worked on <a href="http://compgen.unc.edu/wp/?page_id=253">a dynamic
        programming&ndash;based tool</a>
        and <a href="http://compgen.unc.edu/ancestry">an HMM-based tool</a> for
        ancestry inference.</p>

      <p>I have played the piano since age 7, winning Honorable Mention in the
      Young Artist I division of the 2006 Raleigh Area Piano Teachers'
      Assocation Young Artist Auditions. In 2012, I was awarded
      an <a href="http://web.mit.edu/music/performance/emerson.html">MIT
      Emerson Music Fellowship</a>. I have studied with John
