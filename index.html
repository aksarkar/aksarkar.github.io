    <div id="about">
      <p>I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="http://mit.edu">Massachusetts
          Institute of Technology</a>. Refer to my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a> for
        more detailed information.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>My main research interests are the genotype-to-phenotype problem,
        epigenetics, regulatory genomics, systems genetics, and integrative
        analysis. I am particularly interested in developing novel algorithms,
        statistical methods, and software tools for dissecting the genetic basis
        of human disease.</p>

      <p>I currently work in the <a href="http://compbio.mit.edu"> Computational
          Biology group</a> with <a href="http://mit.edu/~manoli">Manolis
          Kellis</a> at the <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/">Computer Science
          and Artificial Intelligence Lab</a>.</p>
      <p>My current work develops methods to query how genotype contributes to
        human disease. We integrate epigenetic information from
        the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/">ENCODE</a>
        and <a href="khttp://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/">Roadmap
          Epigenomics</a> consortia to identify cell-type&ndash;specific enhancers
        which show systematic bias in p-values for association with a variety of
        complex diseases. Moreover, these enrichments persist when considering
        thousands of independent loci.</p>

      <h2>Other interests</h2>
      <p>I have played the piano since age 7 and was awarded Honorable Mention
        in the 2006 Raleigh Area Piano Teachers' Assocation Young Artist
        Auditions
        and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/music/performance/emerson.html">MIT
          Emerson Music Fellowships</a> in 2012 and 2013. I have studied with John
        Herrmann, <a href="http://www.music.umd.edu/faculty/music_directory/piano/Mayron_Tsong">Mayron
          Tsong</a>, and <a href="http://clarayangpiano.com/">Clara Yang</a>. I
        currently study
        with <a href="http://www.umb.edu/academics/cla/faculty/timothy_mcfarland">Timothy
          McFarland</a>.</p>
