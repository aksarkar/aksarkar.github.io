    <div id="about">
      <p>I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="http://mit.edu">Massachusetts
          Institute of Technology</a>. Refer to my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a> for
        more detailed information.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>My main research interests are complex trait genomics, regulatory
        genomics, and epigenomics. I work on algorithms and statistical methods
        to elucidate the genetic basis of human disease.</p>

      <p>I currently work in the <a href="http://compbio.mit.edu">
          Computational Biology group</a>
          with <a href="http://mit.edu/~manoli">Manolis Kellis</a> at
          the <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/">Computer Science and
          Artificial Intelligence Lab</a>.</p>

      <p>I have developed methods to query how genetic variation which does not
        alter protein-coding sequences contributes to human disease. We
        integrate epigenomic information from
        the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/">ENCODE</a>
        and <a href="khttp://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/">Roadmap
        Epigenomics</a> consortia to identify cell-type&ndash;specific
        enhancers enriched for disease associated variants, and additional
        information about the transcriptional regulatory network to dissect
        their mechanistic role in psychiatric, metabolic, and autoimmune
        disorders.</p>

      <p>My current work develops efficient Bayesian methods to understand the
      architecture of common diseases: how many causal genetic variants are
      there, where in the genome do they reside, and how should we design
      studies to more rapidly discover them in the population?</p>

      <h2>Other interests</h2>
      <p>I have played the piano since age 7 and was awarded Honorable Mention
        in the 2006 Raleigh Area Piano Teachers' Assocation Young Artist
        Auditions
        and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/music/performance/emerson.html">MIT
        Emerson Music Fellowships</a> in 2012 and 2013. I have studied with
        John
        Herrmann, <a href="http://www.music.umd.edu/faculty/music_directory/piano/Mayron_Tsong">Mayron
        Tsong</a>, <a href="http://clarayangpiano.com/">Clara Yang</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.umb.edu/academics/cla/faculty/timothy_mcfarland">Timothy
